# Onepage Template

This is the repository for our onepage template for stand-alone presentation website, manipulating data coming from a either a LDP or a wordpress backend providing JSON-LD resources.

This aims to be a sexy onepage template with stunning parallax and smoot-scroll effect displaying all the basic information related to a project and/or a company, possibly in a multilingual friendly manner.

Individuals templates are written using the handlebars library, and will be rewritten in an associated repository in a WebComponents way.
